    - The 'Home' button should go to the first page and the 'Contact us' button should go to the second page, the other buttons should go to the error page (explained in the mandatory requirements).
- **Footer**
    - The Footer should be on both pages, with a design faithful to `Figma`; 
    - The 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'Twitter' and 'LinkedIn' icons should be clickable, leading to the homepage of each social network;
    - The Footer link for 'Contact us' should go to the second page, the other buttons should go to the error page.
